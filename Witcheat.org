* First things first!

The first thing you might want to do as soon as you install
Witchmacs is to change your font. To do this, do the following:

>M-x customize-face

>Customize face (default 'all faces'): default

Where M-x means press "Meta x" where meta is, usually, left alt.
Then type "customize-face" without the quotes and press <RET> (enter).
You'll get a little prompt at the bottom that says "Customize face
(default 'all faces'):". Type in "default" and press <RET>. Your
current active buffer will change to the *Customize Face: Default*
buffer and give you this nice gui screen where you can change your
font. In the field right after "Font Family" type in the name
of the font you want to use in Witchmacs. After you're done, do:

>C-x k

><RET>

To kill the customization screen.
Witchmacs cheatsheet is a work in progress!
