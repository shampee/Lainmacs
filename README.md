The cutest Emacs distribution

# Introduction
Configuration files for emacs to add a cute Marisa image and a few custom snippets

# Why would I use this?
>*What's the difference between a villain and a super villain? Presentation!*

Currently, the appeal of Witchmacs is seeing a cute Marisa picture everytime you start up Emacs. Also, it is a very basic config which means you can easily add, edit or remove things as you like. You can use this as a building block when making your OWN Emacs config!

# Quick install
`git clone https://github.com/snackon/Witchmacs ~/.emacs.d`

After running this command, the first time you run Emacs will download all of the specified packages in the config.org file, so please be patient!

# Dependencies
`clang` as backend for C and C++ snippets

# TODO
* Add and configure some extra packages (org mode, diminish, etc)
* Make dashboard cooler
* Make custom Witchmacs theme
* Clean up/organize init.el
