Configuration files for emacs to add a cute Marisa image and a few custom snippets

# Notes

You must change the `"path/to/marisa.png"` part in the init.el file to where your Marisa picture is

This is a very messy emacs config and I have a lot of cleaning up to do so if you want to help, please go ahead
